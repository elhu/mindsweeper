# Minesweeper

## How to play

Simple Minesweeper game, just checkout the repo and 

```
$> ./minesweeper BOARD_WIDTH BOARD_HEIGHT NB_OF_MINE
```

The board will be printed between each play, and you'll be prompt to enter the coordinates of your next move.

Coordinates are given in the form ``x y``.

# TODO

* Error handling on game launch (too much mines for the board, etc...)
* Error handling on user input (out of bounds coordinates, missing coordinates)
* Being able to win game
